Create the baseline functions for the model, such as how the impact of humidity is reduced gradually as the temperature increases
and the distance between objects is reduced.

Add and define variables to equations and as constants such as wind, material type that is burning, slope, etc.

Begin to replicate the Forest Fire model from Giordano, but adjust it to model multiple variables at the same time and our defined
functions.

Begin to run the animations on test cases to figure out how I want to animate the project.
