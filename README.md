# Fire_Away_Project
Final Project for Computational Physics

Create a model that emulates a forest fire, and can be animated to display the calculated results. Also, adjust factors to show how fires can spread in different environments and how the spread can vary based on conditions. In order to avoid repition, all necessary functions will be imported from a created file called "Functions",  where they can also be edited or modified. The goal of this project is to create a model effective enough to deeper the understanding of forest fires.
