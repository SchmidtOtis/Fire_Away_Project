Create the baseline functions for the model, such as how the impact of humidity is reduced gradually as the temperature increases
and the distance between objects is reduced.

Add and define variables to equations and as constants such as wind, material type that is burning, slope, etc.

Begin to replicate the Forest Fire model from Giordano, but adjust it to model multiple variables at the same time and our defined
functions.

Begin to run the animations on test cases to figure out how I want to animate the project.

Functions:
Vegetation Spacing = randomly generated distance between cells, defined within a certain range
Ground vegetation burnability = output of either True, it can burn, or False, it cannot
Slope = considering the spacing, adjusts certain burn probabilities for a sloped region which will be a constant
Wind = randomly generated wind values which also impact burn probability outputs
Percolation = considers equations above as well as resources that have been allocated, outputs final burn probability

Schedule:
End of 5/1: Working functions, animation adjusted to take in our data, revising functions to get optimal outputs
Monday, 5/4: Debugged project, have a model that can be easily adjusted to display a wide range of conditions
Wednesday, 5/6: Begin presentation, polish details, get ready to present
Friday, 5/8: Project is finished
